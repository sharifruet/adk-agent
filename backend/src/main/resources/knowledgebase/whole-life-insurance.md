**Q: Can I stop paying premiums?**
A: You can use cash value to pay premiums, or convert to a paid-up policy with reduced coverage.

**Q: Is whole life a good investment?**
A: It's primarily insurance with a savings component. Returns are typically lower than other investments but offer guarantees.
